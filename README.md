# ProjectYo
Development of a SVM predictor of membrane proteins, classifying globular, helical, inside and outside loop residues.

/scripts - various scripts used to parse input, train and save models, predict using models

/data - data files used to train the models, output files 

/generated models - models using different windowsizes, default setting for LinearSVC. 

TO DO:
  - Make sure only relevant scripts are in the scripts folder.
  - Add documentation as to how to use the predictor in my Diary
  - Add shebangs in relevant scripts
  - Make sure there are path directories for outputting files, parse_code, humble_python, humble_python_predict 
  - Add argv arguments for file input for training and predicting scripts, default model for fridays deadline
