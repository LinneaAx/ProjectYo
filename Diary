#entry 17/2, created makefolders.sh, much fun. Look into how to add to PATH at SU computer
Create a folder in your home directory and let's call it myscripts.
Do ls -lart on your home directory, to identify the start-up script your shell is using. It should either be .profile or .bashrc.
Once you have identified the start up script, add the following line in your script - export set PATH=$PATH:~/myscript.
Once added, source your start-up script or log out and log back in.
Execute your script using script name.
