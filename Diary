#entry 17/2, created makefolders.sh, much fun. Look into how to add to PATH at SU computer
Create a folder in your home directory and let's call it myscripts.
Do ls -lart on your home directory, to identify the start-up script your shell is using. It should either be .profile or .bashrc.
Once you have identified the start up script, add the following line in your script - export set PATH=$PATH:~/myscript.
Once added, source your start-up script or log out and log back in.
Execute your script using script name.


#entry 23/2
Searching for articles on specifically SVMs. Binary or multiple classifyer? 

#entry 24/2
Send all papers to Arne + project plan. 

#entry 25/2
Start making presentation for paper. Two binary SVMs after each other. Separates 4 states. Should I do the same? 

#entry 26/2
Starting with the parser. Input file, separate the name, sequence, feature. Make the sliding windows for the sequence.
How is the sequence input to the SVM supposed to look? Matrix where each sequence is a row, each window is an element of that row?
Or is each window a row and each matrix a sequence? 
If I want two binary classifyers after each other, do I need to change G, I, O to all be "not membrane helix" in the first classifyer?
How do I input additional features? Hydrophobicity etc? 

#entry 27/2 working with the right input format for the SVM. 
decided to not focus on making the perfect SVM, focus on the project handling

#entry 28/2 The modular nice script is not ready for the friday deadline.
Put everything in the same file for training and predicting. It takes a single sequence for prediction. 
Present and evaluate group presentations. Got good feedback on what to change.
Looking into shebangs and chmod -x, want to make all my scripts executable. 

#entry 1/3 Preparing for the presentation between skiing and relaxing. 

#entry 5/3 Rewriting a lot to make the scripts work together.
Will start by making a python script for running several functions together. Is it a good idea to create the binary input files and save them?  

#entry 6/3 wrote a script to split out all the membrane proteins and an equal number of globular proteins. total around 600 proteins. 
running 3 residue window training for 600 proteins takes around 3 minutes. 
Started a run of testing windowsizes between 3 and 33 for the protein split dataset. 

#entry 7/3 The run worked, yay, however I want to try bigger windowsizes as the cross_val_score did not reach a maxima. 
Having problems using ssh with the computers, scripts get terminated etc. Try to run over night. 
Reoganized my files, remember to add new file directories in the humble files.
